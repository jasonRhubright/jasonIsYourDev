# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases the codebase for my personal portfolio website running on WordPress 6.4.2. The site highlights three unique projects and underscores the craftsmanship behind its development.

## Technologies Used

- **Webflow:** The initial version of the website was built on Webflow, utilizing its design capabilities.

- **WordPress:** The code was later transformed into a custom WordPress template for enhanced functionality and dynamic content management.

- **Custom WordPress Plugin:** The contact form on the site is powered by a custom WordPress plugin developed personally. This plugin communicates with an external API, ensuring prompt email notifications upon form submission. Security is a priority, and the plugin employs built-in WordPress functions, including nonce verification and REST routes.

## Features

- **Dynamic Content Management:** The homepage text can be seamlessly updated through the homepage editor, offering flexibility and ease of use.

- **Project Listings:** Keeping project information up-to-date is simple. A custom post type named "Projects" was implemented to dynamically populate project data across the site, including project pages, headers, footers, and the home page.

- **Advanced Custom Fields:** To manage extensive project metadata with precision, the capabilities of Advanced Custom Fields were harnessed. This architecture enables effortless updates to project listings and introductory text through the user-friendly interface of WordPress.
